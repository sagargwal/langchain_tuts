text spliter is a process of breaking large piece of text into smaller chunks
that an llm can handle efficiently
advantage 
overcoming model limitation 
many models have input limitation, text spliting allows models to work on text that are more than thier limit by spliting 
or they have context length limit that needs to be considered this method allows bigger chucnks to split and the input

text spliting improves tasks like 
emmbeding, simantic search and summerization

optimizing computational resources like we need a certain memory and gpu to process based upon words
