vector stores
if the obejctive is to build a system where the work is to give recommendation or search 
on the bases of context similarity 

for example to build a system where we need to build a movie recommendation system
but the recommendation should be based upon plot rather then just key words

here the objective should be to first convert the plot into vector of 
equal dimensions, then in that dimensional space we would need to find the 
vector closest to the query vector should be given as the recommendation

but thier are some problems here 

thier would be millions of plots and we can not process emmebeding for 
all plots every time we guve recoomendation so storing it is neccesary 

but the store we store them should have some features 

storage - the store should have options to keep the data in memory or in disk 
for quick look up and storage 

similarity search - help look for vector for best simiarity score

indexing -  the problem even after storing the data can be can be to calculate 
nearest distance of angular distance from very vector for each query 
so the vector database should have algo to find similarity score quickly 

on of the method could to form clusters and make an average vector of a cluster 
and first calculate distance of query vector with custer average and than with other vectors of that 
cluster 

CRUD - vector store should give access to perform crud operations create read update delete 


vector store vs vector database 
A vector store is a software component that saves embeddings and lets you perform similarity search, often in-memory or tightly coupled to an application.
A vector database is a full database system built around vectors, providing persistence, indexing, scaling, filtering, and production-grade reliability.
