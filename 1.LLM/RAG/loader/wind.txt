The wind arrives without a face,
a rumor moving through the day.
It slips between the ribs of trees,
and teaches leaves how to pray.
It smells of roads and distant rain,
of salt, of dust, of old goodbyes.
It hums along electric wires,
a restless song the city sighs.
It lifts the hem of silent fields,
and combs the wheat with unseen hands.
It bends the grass, not out of force,
but with the art of gentle commands.
It knows the language of the birds,
the grammar used by drifting seeds.
It reads the clouds like open books,
and edits them to fit its needs.
It knocks once softly on the door,
then bursts inside with laughing feet.
It steals the warmth from summer skin,
and lays it down on colder streets.
In winter it is sharp and thin,
a blade that whistles as it flies.
It writes its name on frozen lakes,
then signs it with the ache of ice.
In spring it smells of something new,
of broken soil and honest bloom.
It carries pollen, hope, and dust,
and sweeps the corners of the gloom.
In summer it is breath and balm,
a mercy moving through the heat.
It dries the tears of overheated days,
and cools the pulse of crowded streets.
In autumn it becomes a poet,
rehearsing loss in amber tones.
It gathers leaves like letters sent,
from dying trees to waiting bones.
It never stays, it never owns,
no house, no hill, no stretch of sky.
Yet every place it passes through,
remembers that it wandered by.
It shapes the dunes, it sculpts the snow,
it sands the edges of our pride.
It teaches mountains how to bow,
and oceans how to turn the tide.
It listens more than it commands,
though everything responds the same.
From flickered flame to storming sea,
all rise and answer to its name.
It is the breath of moving time,
the pulse between the then and now.
A constant leaving, constant return,
a vow it breaks, a kept somehow.
It carries whispers of the dead,
and laughter from the yet-to-be.
It knows our secrets better than
the locks we trust so carefully.
It plays the flute of hollow bones,
of chimneys, alleys, mountain caves.
It drums upon the roofs at night,
and rocks the restless, rocks the brave.
It tangles hair and scattered thoughts,
it ruins plans and clears the mind.
It shows us how to let things go,
by never looking back behind.
It cannot be contained or caught,
no net, no jar, no clever word.
Yet every child has felt its hand,
and every heart has somehow heard.
It is the answer without speech,
the motion born from silent will.
A force that moves because it must,
because the world refuses still.
It leans against the edge of sleep,
and turns the pages of our dreams.
It enters lungs, then leaves again,
a guest who never really seems.
When anger rises, it can howl,
when peace arrives, it learns to sigh.
It mirrors us in passing moods,
then leaves us wondering why.
It asks for nothing, gives no proof,
yet shapes the fate of flame and sail.
Empires fall by ignoring it,
and kites are saved by knowing its trail.
It is the oldest traveler,
younger than fire, older than stone.
A story told by moving air,
a road that walks itself alone.
When I am lost, I feel it pass,
a hand upon my unseen back.
It does not say which way to go,
but shows me I can still unpack.
One day my voice will join its choir,
a breath released from fragile skin.
Until that time, I stand and listen,
to hear where all my thoughts have been.
The wind moves on, as winds must do,
a lesson written, then erased.
It leaves the world a little changed,
and never waits to be embraced.
